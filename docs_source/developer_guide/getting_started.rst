Getting started and how to contribute
---------------------------------------

There are multiple ways to contribute to BioNumPy, such as writing documentation, making examples or developing on the code base. For all contributions, follow these steps:

1) :ref:`Set up your development environment<development_setup>`

2) Make a dedicated branch for your contribution and make a `pull-request <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_ on Github when you are done.

3) Before making your Pull-request, check that everything is working :ref:`running all tests<testing>`.

4) Follow one of these guides depending on what you want to do:
    * :ref:`Writing documentation<writing_documentation>`
    * :ref:`Making examples<making_examples>`
    * :ref:`Developing on the code base<design_principles>`
