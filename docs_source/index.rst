Getting started with BioNumPy
======================================

BioNumPy is a Python library for easy and efficient representation and analysis of biological data.
Since BioNumPy builds on the interface of NumPy, people already used to NumPy or array programming should find BioNumPy very easy to get started with.

..
    With BioNumPy, our goal is that everyone should be able to write simple, clean code that scales well to large biological datasets.
**Getting started with BioNumpy takes only a minute:**

1) Install:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install bionumpy

2) Read your data:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import bionumpy as bnp
    >>> reads = bnp.open("example_data/small.fa").read()
    >>> reads
    SequenceEntry with 3 entries
                         name                 sequence
                        read1  ACACATCACAGCTACGACGA...
                        read2  AACACTTGGGGGGGGGGGGG...
                        read3  AACTGGACTAGCGACGTACT...

3) Analyse it like you would do with NumPy:

    >>> gc_content = np.mean((reads.sequence == "C") | (reads.sequence == "G"))
    >>> gc_content
    0.5526315789473685

BioNumpy can be used to analyse a wide range of data. Follow one of the guides below:
